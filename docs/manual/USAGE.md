## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Wallet not connecting**: Ensure your wallet is unlocked and refresh the page
- **Principal ID not validating**: Check for any spaces or special characters that might have been copied
- **Transaction failing**: Verify you have enough FREEOS tokens and a small amount of XPR for transaction fees
- **QR code timing out**: If the QR code expires, simply click the Connect button again
